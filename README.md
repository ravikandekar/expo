# React Native Task Management App (Expo)

## Overview
This is a full-featured React Native app built using Expo. It includes authentication and task management functionalities with JWT-based authentication and JSON as the data source. The app ensures a modern and attractive UI with proper state management using React Context API.

## Features

### Authentication
- **Signup Screen**: Users can register with their name, email, and password.
- **Login Screen**: Users can log in with their email and password.
- **JWT Token Authentication**: Tokens are stored using `AsyncStorage` for session management.
- **Logout**: Clears stored token and navigates back to the login screen.

### Task Management
- **Home Screen**: Displays a list of tasks from a JSON file (simulating an API response). Includes pull-to-refresh.
- **Add Task Screen**: Users can create a new task with a title and description.
- **Task Details Screen**: Displays task details and allows users to edit or delete tasks.

## Tech Stack & Tools
- **State Management**: React Context API (wrapped properly for API handling)
- **Navigation**: React Navigation (Stack Navigator)
- **Storage**: AsyncStorage (for JWT tokens)
- **UI Library**: NativeBase (for an attractive UI)
